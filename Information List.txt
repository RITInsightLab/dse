Approximately every 11 years, the Sun 
reverses its overall magnetic polarity:
its north magnetic pole becomes a
south pole, and vice versa.

Plants use light energy from the Sun to
undergo photosynthesis. This produces
energy (glucose) that animals and
humans need to eat to survive.

The Sun is orbited by eight major planets:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Four million tons of hydrogen are consumed
 by the Sun every second, which helps to
 create the Sun’s composition of 75 percent
 hydrogen, 23 percent helium, and 2 percent
 heavier elements.

Unlike the planets, the Sun is great big
sphere of hydrogen gas. Because of this,
different parts of the Sun rotate at different speeds.

Light takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds to
reach the Earth when the Earth is 93 million
miles away from the Sun. This distance is
the average distance from the Sun to the Earth.

If you could take the 50 closest stars within
17 light-years of the Earth, the Sun would
be the 4th brightest star in absolute terms.

While evidence suggests fluctuations in
solar activity can affect climate on Earth,
the majority of climate scientists and
astrophysicists agree that the sun is
not to blame for the current and historically
sudden increase in global temperatures on 
Earth, which have mostly been caused by 
the human race.

The sun rotates on its axis once every 25.38 Earth days.

The Sun emits UV rays which are harmful
to humans and animals. Thankfully, the
ozone layer absorbs mosts of the UV rays.
This stops them from coming to the Earth’s surface.

This is the Sun in the light of Fe XX, an iron
atom with 19 electrons removed. The wavelength
is 131 angstroms, and the temperature of the
plasma is a scorching 18 million degrees Fahrenheit.

Each solar flare can give off up to 6 × 1025
joules of energy, about a sixth of the
sun's total energy output.

Solar flares such as this can produce highly
energetic particles known as a solar proton event.

About 3/4 of the sun's mass is made of hydrogen.

The sun is 85% brighter than most stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

Our Sun emits light at every wavelength
in the electromagnetic spectrum, but it
is ultraviolet waves that are responsible
for causing our sunburns.

The ancient Greeks called the Sun "Helios".

A person weighing 150 pounds on Earth
would weigh 4,200 pounds on the Sun
because the Sun's gravity is 28 times
that of Earth.

The Sun is a natural source of visible
light waves and our eyes see the
reflection of this sunlight off the objects around us.

All planets orbit the Sun in the same
direction, counterclockwise, and on roughly
the same plane, known as the eliptic.

The sun has six regions - the core,
the radiative zone, the convective zone, 
the photosphere, the chromosphere, 
and the corona.

The heat that we feel from sunlight, a fire, 
a radiator, or a warm sidewalk is infrared.

The Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of
hydrogen each second.

Surprisingly, the higher in the chromosphere
the higher the temperature. Scientists theorize
magnetohydrodynamic waves might be 
the source of this extra heat.

The longest prominence ever recorded was
430,000 miles long.

The term "chromosphere" literally means
color sphere.

The Sun has a diameter of about 1,392,000 km.

Bright regions on the Sun's photosphere
affecting solar energy output.

Solar flares are jets of particles that
burst from the Sun and can disrupt 
satellite communications and knock
out electricity on Earth.

The Greek philosopher Aristarchus is
credited as being the first person
to claim that the Earth orbited the Sun.

The Sun is 92.96 million miles from the Earth.

About one million Earths could fit inside the Sun.

The Sun radiates heat and a steady
stream of charged particles known 
as the solar wind, which blows about
280 miles per second throughout the solar system.

The Sun is about 4.5 billion years old.

Changes in the number of faculae and
sunspots may play a role in global climate change.

Magneto

White regions indicate where the magnetic field is big 
going into the photosphere, going into the Sun, this is
also the equivalent of magnetic South.

Dark Spots indicate where the magnetic field is big and
coming out of the photosphere, coming out of the Sun, 
this is also the equivalent of magnetic North.

The ancient Romans called the Sun "Sol", which was
translated into "sun" in modern English.

Grey indicates that there is no magnetic field.

The Sun rotates on its axis once every 25.38 Earth
days or 609.12 hours.

The Sun contains 99.85% of the mass in the solar system.

They usually come in pairs. Notice how there are white spots right next to black spots.

At its core, the Sun's temperature is about 27 million
degrees Fahrenheit.
